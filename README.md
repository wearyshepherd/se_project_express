# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
In this project, I learned how to operate on the back end of a previous project using Postman, MongoDB, and VSCode.  I created routes for different functions including creating, liking, unliking, deleting, and getting items.  I added error messages depending on the type of error received when running the code.  I check with Postman to make sure everything was running properly when working through errors.  This project helps back end developers understand how requests are sent to a server and what they do if there is an error and how to spot it with programs like Postman and MongoDB.
