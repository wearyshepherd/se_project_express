# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
In this project, I learned how to operate on the back end of a previous project using Postman, MongoDB, and VSCode.  I created routes for different functions including creating, liking, unliking, deleting, and getting items.  I added error messages depending on the type of error received when running the code.  I check with Postman to make sure everything was running properly when working through errors.  This project helps back end developers understand how requests are sent to a server and what they do if there is an error and how to spot it with programs like Postman and MongoDB. 
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
